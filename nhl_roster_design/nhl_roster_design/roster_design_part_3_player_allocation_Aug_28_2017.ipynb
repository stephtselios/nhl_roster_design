    "Upon completion of evaluation of overall performance for all skaters, each player will be categorized and assigned to their respectful position within the roster of their team. The fundamental statistic used to differentiate top from bottom players, is zone start percentage. There are three zones from where plays can be started: offensive, neutral and defensive. Offensive zone start percentage is calculated by the number of face-offs held in the attacking area divided by the sum of face-offs an individual player was on the ice for. Identically, defensive zone start percentage is computed by the number of face-offs taken in their own territory divided by the total face-offs each player was on the ice for. Skaters who are talented in creating opportunities and producing goals will have a greater percentage of offensive zone starts in comparison to defensive zone starts. Equivalently, players who are skilled in preventing chances and goals being conceded, will have a higher defensive zone start percentage in correlation to offensive zone starts. In other words, top six forwards and top four pairing defensemen will start much of their shifts in the zone their opponent whereas bottom six forwards and bottom pairing defensemen in their own zone.\n"
