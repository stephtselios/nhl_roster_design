# process of roster design analysis
## 1) import stored data frame
## 2) goal number variable to be filled backwards for all event type prior to a goal
## 3) goal time variable to be filled backwards for all event type prior to a goal, with the actual time of goal.
## 4) generate a variable that will calculate the time difference between events and goal
## 5) keep only events that happened 20 seconds prior to a goal
## 6) group events by goal number in a game
## 7) count the occurance of each event prior to a given goal
## 8) sum by event type to display the incidence of each event in two games
## 9) establish the impact of each event on a goal.
## 10) assign values to players based on their participation in events that led to a goal.
