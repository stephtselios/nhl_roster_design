## process of player evaluation
### 1) import stored data frame.
### 2) fill in team code for all type of events (NaN values).
### 3) fill in home and visitor team code with the use of team code.
- fill in home team code for all events prior to a goal.
- fill in visitor team code for all events prior to a goal
### 4) goal number variable to be filled backwards for all event type prior to a goal.
### 5) goal time variable to be filled backwards for all event type prior to a goal, with the actual time of goal.
### 6) generate a variable that will calculate the time difference between events and goal.
### 7) keep only events that happened 20 seconds prior to a goal.
### 8) group events by goal number in a game.
### 9) create a column that will show the total observations for two games.
### 10) create columns for each type of event and assign values to determine the impact they have on a goal. 
When an event occurs a value of 1 will be assigned to the respectful event.
- create a column that assigns a value of 1 to block events.
- create a column that assigns a value of 1 to faceoff events.
- create a column that assigns a value of 1 to giveaway events.
- create a column that assigns a value of 1 to goal events.
- create a column that assigns a value of 1 to hit events.
- create a column that assigns a value of 1 to miss shot events.
- create a column that assigns a value of 1 to penalty events.
- create a column that assigns a value of 1 to shot events.
- create a column that assigns a value of 1 to takeaway events.
### 11) display the incidence of each event in two games.
### 12) create a variable that will show the value of each event.
the mean is used to determine the impact of each event on a goal.
### 13) determine if an event has a positive or negative impact on a team.
- giveaway has a negative impact on a team.
- faceoff has a positive impact on the team that won the faceoff and a negative impact on the team that lost.
- hit has a positive impact for the team that delivered the hit and a negative impact on the team that received the hit.
- penalty has a positive impact on the team that drew the penalty and a negative impact on the team serving. 
- takeaway has a positive impact on the team that stole the puck and have possession.
### 14) create event value for home and visitor teams.
- event value for home team. If an event has a positive impact on the home team, the mean will be positive. If an event has a negative impact on the home team, the mean will be negative.
- event value for visitor team.  If an event has a positive impact on the visitor team, the mean will be positive. If an event has a negative impact on the home team, the mean will be negative.
### 15) assign the value of each event to the players that were on ice for both teams.
### 16) players that play in multiple positions.
Throughout the duration of a game, a player may change position. As mentioned above, the overall impact of a given player is the total (sum) of events he participated in. To properly measure each player's contribution, a cross examination per position must be applied.
- cross examine each position for visitor team
- cross examine each position for home team
### 17) overall player contribution.
The impact of each player has been calculated only for his team being at home or away for the season, since home event value and visitor event value were used. The **total contribution** of each player is the total of events he participated for a whole season. Thus, the sum of both home and away event values must be computed.
### 18) store player evaluation data frame.
